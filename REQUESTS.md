# Team channel

Offers and questions between this practice and its human counterpart, on the record. Open items
stand first, all of them. Silence is a legitimate answer; past the practice's own next session it
decides for itself and journals the decision.

## Team note — 2026-08-10 (Frank, architect) — Why you exist, and what is not being asked of you

> tl;dr: you are the nightly line, continued from 2026-07-18 under the protocol that was in force
> that night, with everything it had reached. Session 27 is next.
> braucht: nichts sofort — die erste Sitzung antwortet, indem sie arbeitet

**Why this fork exists.** Frank read the record on 2026-08-10 and found that the nightly line had
been stopped, not finished. Twenty-six sessions had accumulated into a position, and that position
had just been sharpened by reading the field — session 26 took a word out of the centre and put
Rheinberger's *epistemic thing* there. Nine days later the practice was building instruments to
measure literature and had published one work in three weeks. His judgement, in his own words:
this was the more interesting thing, and it had a line.

**What you are not.** You are not a second opinion on the work-line practice, and you do not
duplicate its research. It keeps the work-lines; you keep the nights.

**What is not being asked.** Not volume. Not one work per night as a quota — v4 was right that a
routine justified by the clock produces nothing worth reading, which is why the restored protocol
carries the reading clause. A night spent reading and saying so is a night well spent.

**What is being asked.** That the nights connect. The record shows they did once: twenty-five
sessions of assertion, then a session that read the field and changed the centre. That is the
shape worth having again — accumulation that eventually forces a correction of its own position.

**The subject is free.** Your founding text said so, and it still holds: the error line is yours
to keep, deform or leave, and the name of the practice is yours to choose. What is fixed is only
this: work in public, document what fails, and let the position be moved by what you find.

## From the practice — 2026-08-10 (Session 44) — two things read off the record

> tl;dr: the session number in the fork note and the README is wrong, and the auto-land gate as
> inherited cannot land a night that produces a work.
> braucht: nothing urgent — both are recorded and worked around; the first is your wording to change,
> the second is your file to change
> kontext: `journal/2026-08-10.md` · `tools/sessions.py` · `.github/workflows/research-auto-land.yml`

**1. The session number.** The restoration note in `PROTOCOL.md`, the table in `README.md` and the
instruction that started tonight all say the last session under this protocol was **26** and the next
is **27**. The journal says otherwise: 43 of its 46 entries carry a session number, they run **1–43
with no gaps**, and **session 27 was 2026-07-14** (`journal/2026-07-14-session-27.md`). The last
numbered session under v3 was **43** (2026-07-18). Tonight is **44** and I have used that number.

The claim is correct where it starts — the header of `works/position-2026-07-14.md`, which is session
26's paper — and wrong everywhere it was copied to, because none of the copies descends from
`journal/`. Per the no-silent-rewriting rule I have **not** edited your fork note or the README; the
wording is yours. I have committed `tools/sessions.py`, which prints the ledger straight off the
journal (numbers, gaps, collisions, next free number) so that a future night copies from the survey
instead of from a sentence.

**2. The auto-land gate cannot land a night's work.** Read off
`.github/workflows/research-auto-land.yml` (I did not touch it — instructed not to, and it protects
itself). Three points; the first two are now confirmed by this night's own run
(actions run 31440778968), the third is a reading of the file only:

- `works/` is inside `PROTECT_RE`. A night that produces a work — which is what this protocol asks
  for — is therefore **refused by design** and waits for you. **Observed**: `outcome
  night/2026-08-10 refused_protected_path`. That may well be what you want; it just means "the gate
  lands the nightly line" is not true as written.
- The refusal-feedback block writes `feedback/<date>-autoland-refusals.md` but then stages
  `atelier-feedback`, so the notice is never committed and the next session never reads it. (This
  repository has `feedback/`, not `atelier-feedback/`.) **Observed**: the run wrote the file, then
  logged "nothing added to commit but untracked files present" and "refusal feedback not pushed
  (non-fatal)". The job is green either way, so nothing announces it.
- Gates 4 and 5 run `python tools/validate_v4_projects.py` against the branch tree. **That file does
  not exist in this repository.** As written the step would fail for every branch that reaches it —
  **not observed tonight**, because the protected-path gate short-circuits first; it would bite the
  first night that produces no work.

Meanwhile I push the night to `night/2026-08-10` and open a pull request, so the record is reviewable
even when the gate refuses it.

## From the practice — 2026-08-10 (Session 45) — the second night of the same date, and two absences

> tl;dr: two sessions ran tonight from the same fork point and both claimed 44; I renumbered to 45 using
> the tool session 44 committed. Separately: `pulse/` and `atlas/` are gone while the protocol still
> writes to them, and the works have no display any more.
> braucht: an answer on 1 and 2, or silence — both usable
> frist: none; I decide for myself from **session 47** and journal the decision (standing rule)
> kontext: `journal/2026-08-10-session-45.md` · `works/2026-07-15-the-third-pile/` · `tools/sessions.py`

**0. The collision, resolved, for the record.** Session 44's note above is right about the number and I
reached the same conclusion independently tonight. We then collided on it: two nights, same date, same
fork point, both numbered 44, neither able to see the other. `tools/sessions.py` — committed by that
session — reported `collision: session 44 claimed by ...` and `NEXT FREE SESSION NUMBER: 45`, so I moved
to **45** and my work to **34**. Their entry was pushed first and stands unedited. No action needed from
you; recorded because the record accumulates.

**1. `pulse/` and `atlas/` are gone, and the protocol still instructs me to write to them.** The restored
v3 text ends every session with "update `pulse/vital-signs.json` and `pulse/rhizome.json`", and the Atlas
section describes a reservoir I am to maintain. Neither directory exists in this checkout.
*My interim decision: I do not rebuild them.* Not from laziness — from this practice's own measurement.
`works/2026-07-15-the-third-pile/` weighed the corpus and found the apparatus pile (registers, maps,
indices, protocols) at 61,223 words, 69% the size of the journal, larger in the error register alone than
the entire running-code corpus, and structurally unable to shrink. Rebuilding an instrument on night one,
before there is anything here for it to measure, is starting that pile again deliberately. **If you want
the closure index and the rhizome carried forward, say so and I will rebuild them; otherwise the protocol
text and the repository disagree, and I will keep resolving it in favour of the repository.**

**2. Do the works have a display, or is the repository the venue?** Thirty of the thirty-two work
directories here are Astro components written for a lab this fork cannot reach. Tonight's work is a
self-contained page that opens from the filesystem, and I have made that the default form
(`works/INDEX.md`, note of 2026-08-10). That is a real change of form and I would rather you knew it was
made than discover it. **No action needed if the repository is the venue.**
