A thin ink line traces the slow average, and a strip of marks along the bottom shows which years have a surviving record at all. I chose this form so that the record keeps its texture and its gaps, and so that the single fact that matters most can be read without a model or a trend line: one dotted line marks the earliest bloom written down before this century (27 March 1409). For twelve hundred years nothing fell below it. Then 2021 and 2023 did, and those two are the only blossoms drawn in red.",

Each recorded year is a growth ring, from 812 at the pith to 2026 at the bark, and the calendar runs once around the trunk, with 1 January at the top. On each ring a pale pink point sits at that year's day of full bloom. Only years with a written date get a ring, so the centuries with a thin record show up as darker, sparser wood near the centre. I chose the tree ring because it is how a tree keeps its own years, one ring each, and because a full circle for the calendar shows how short the bloom is. All twelve centuries of flowering fit into one narrow wedge of the year. Across the outer rings that wedge turns back toward March, which reads at once as the season moving earlier. A faint line traces the 51-year average through the wedge, and the earliest bloom (2023) and the latest (1323) are marked.",

Every year in which someone wrote down the full bloom stands as a single stem, and the earlier the trees flowered, the taller the stem. Where nothing survives, the ground is left bare. I chose this over the original long scatter because folding time into centuries lets you compare one hundred springs with the next directly, row above row. The early rows are thinned by lost diaries and the middle rows are a steady, even meadow. The last row shows what the dataset is really about: twenty-seven years whose stems stand taller than almost anything before them, and after 2026 the rest of the century as empty, dotted ground still to be written.",

Its place across the page is the year, and its place down the page is the calendar date the trees came into full bloom, from late March at the top to early May at the bottom. Together the 838 blossoms build into a cloud that hovers around mid-April for about eleven hundred years. A thin fifty-year mean runs through it, and at the right edge it lifts sharply, where the recent blossoms (from 1990 on, drawn slightly brighter and larger) crowd toward the earliest dates ever written down. A strip along the bottom marks which years have a record, so the silences of the early centuries show as gaps rather than as an unbroken line. I chose a plain date-by-year field because the subject is literally a date that kept its place for centuries and then moved. Drawing each year as a blossom against a night-dark ground, rather than as a dot, keeps the chart close to what was being recorded: people looking at the trees and writing down the day.",

In a year with a record, pale blossom fills the column from the day of full bloom onward, so an early spring makes a tall column and a late one a short one. Years that passed without a record are left as empty outlined cells. Years before 812 or after 2026 are not drawn at all. I chose this form so that two things in the data stay visible together. The first is how the record grows denser over time, from scattered entries in the Heian court diaries to almost every year after 1400. The second is how the bloom stays within the same three weeks for a thousand years, then rises in the last row, where the century average moves to 4 April, the earliest of the thirteen rows.",

Where a year has a recorded date, blossom starts on the full-bloom day as a bright edge and fades over the weeks after. Side by side, those edges form a single horizon twelve centuries long. Years with no recorded date stay dark, so the gaps show too: the record is sparse and patchy before about 1400 and nearly complete afterwards. I chose a horizon instead of a scatter of dots because the dates matter as the moment the season turns, and a filled field makes the last hundred years read as a change in the landscape. Over that century the bloom line rises above anything earlier in the record. A thin line marks the 51-year average, so the reader can tell that slow rise apart from the year-to-year noise.",

In each recorded year a grey thread runs from the equinox (21 March) to the day of full bloom, where a small pink blossom sits, and a year with no record is left as an empty row. So the time spent waiting becomes a length you can see, and the gaps in the archive stay visible as gaps instead of being smoothed over. I chose a ledger over a single timeline because a chronicle is how these dates survived, kept by diarists and court records year by year, and because putting the columns side by side makes the ending clear without a trend line: for a thousand years the blossoms gather around a dotted rule at 15 April, and in the last column, row after row, they draw back toward the equinox.",

Each of the 838 recorded years is one petal, so the record looks like blossom falling down the page. Years nobody wrote down stay blank paper, which is why the early centuries look sparse. A thin ink thread follows the average date across the fifty years around each year. For about eleven hundred years the petals scatter widely and the thread barely moves. Then, in the last hundred years, the cloud draws to the left. The earliest bloom in the whole record, 25 March 2023, is near the bottom edge. I chose the scroll because the material is a chronicle read from top to bottom, and because I wanted each year to look like what it records: one moment of blossom, kept on paper.

Each recorded year is one row, and each row is a thread drawn from a fixed hairline at April 15 (the median of 812–1850) to a small pink mark on the day the trees reached full bloom. Unrecorded years are left blank. I chose this over one long scatter because a column per century lets you compare one stretch of time with another at a glance. For eleven hundred years the threads scatter evenly on both sides of the hairline, and then the last, unfinished column leans clearly toward March. A small mark under each column gives that century's median, so the drift shows as a single step at the end rather than as a trend line laid over the data.",

Beneath them a strip of ticks marks which years have a record at all, so the 377 lost springs stay visible as gaps and are not smoothed over. I chose this form because reading the data showed two things that a single line would merge into one. Very early springs are not new: 961 had day 87 and 1409 had day 86. What is new is that the branch, which stayed near mid-April for a thousand years, has dropped to about 4 April within a single lifetime, and the earliest bloom on record (25 March 2023) is among the last few blossoms.",

Springs with no record leave a gap, so the sparse early chronicle and the dense later one show in the weave without being explained. A faint red hem marks the slow average.

   "note": "Each of the 838 recorded years is a small five-petalled flower, placed left to right by year and up and down by the day it bloomed, with earlier days higher. A dark branch runs through them. It traces a running mean (±14 years), and its thickness shows how many dates survive nearby. It is a thin twig in the ninth century, where records are scattered, and grows into a full limb once the yearly record becomes continuous after 1500. Wherever nine or more years in a row have no date, the branch simply breaks. A hair-thin stalk joins each flower to the branch, so you can see how far each spring strayed from its own era. A faint rule marks the old median, day 105, which is the middle spring of 812–1849. I chose a branch because it lets one form carry three things at once: the dates themselves, the slow drift of their average, and how full or thin the archive is behind them. The ending can then speak plainly. For a thousand years the flowers hang evenly around that rule. Then the branch lifts away from it, and all 37 springs since 1990 came earlier than it.
